**SymDALI** is a Mathematica implementation of the DALI algorithm ([Derivative Approximation for LIkelihoods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6892)), utilizing symbolic differentiation. It is actively being developed for applications in [gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02670). 

Below is a comparison between the corner plot of the DALI approximation at order 8 (Black) and the exact Likelihood (Red) for the w₀-wₐ parametrization of dark energy in a mock cosmology catalog. A sequence of marginalizations of DALI, from order 1 to 9, is also shown. Additional figures can be found [here](https://github.com/Felipe-4/SymDALI/tree/main/Demo).
