SymDALI is a Mathematica Implementation of the DALI algorithm ([Derivative Approximation for LIkelihoods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6892)) which makes use of
symbolic differentiation. It is beeing activelly developed to work with gravitational waves. Below is an implementation of the algorithm for 
a supernova mock catalog in the w0-wa parametrization for DarkEnergy.
